Boxenhops
=========

Web development and Hackathon themed Boxen repository.

This is a template Boxen project designed for your organization to fork and
modify appropriately.
The Boxen rubygem and the Boxen puppet modules are only a framework for getting
things done.
This repository template is just a basic example of _how_ to do things with them.

See the [Our-Boxen documentation.](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen)


## Customizing

You can always check out the number of existing modules we already
provide as optional installs under the
[boxen organization](https://github.com/boxen). These modules are all
tested to be compatible with Boxen. Use the `Puppetfile` to pull them
in dependencies automatically whenever `boxen` is run.
